          <p>Way back at the start of the millennium, I wrote my first Perl book.<br>
            It was called <em>Data Munging with Perl</em>.<br>
            It was published by <a href="https://manning.com/">Manning</a>.<br>
            People seemed to like it.</br>
            It has a score of 4.8
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Munging-Perl-Recognition-Transformation/dp/1930110006/">on Amazon</a>.</p>
          <p>In 2014, the book went out of print.<br>
            The rights reverted to me.<br>
            Since then, I've made a PDF of the book available for free from this site.</p>
          <p>Honestly, I think it's still a pretty good book.<br>
            But (as with any technical book published almost twenty-five years ago) it's a little dated.<br>
            So I'm working on a new edition that will be published through
            <a href="https://perlschool.com/">Perl School</a>.<br>
            I'm expecting it'll be available by the end of April 2025.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, the first edition will continue to be available from this site.<br>
            As it's dated, I don't feel right charging for it.<br>
            All I ask is that you sign up to my mailing list.<br>
            If you want, you could unsubscribe immediately.<br>
            But please don't do that.<br>
            It'll keep you up to date with what I'm doing.<br>
            I post stuff to it very infrequently.<br>
            But I plan to change that soon.<br>
            I'll post something any day now.<br>
            Honest!</p>
